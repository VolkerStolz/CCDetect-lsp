# CCDetect-lsp

This is an LSP tool which does duplicate code detection, otherwise known as code-clone
detection. The goal of this tool is to create a completely incremental updating static
analysis tool, which works in the editor setting to provide code analysis in real-time.
The tool is editor and language agnostic, utilizing tree-sitter grammars to parse any
language incrementally. This tool and algorithm is the basis for my master thesis at The
University of Oslo.
